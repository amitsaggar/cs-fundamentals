## Python

Interpreter Vs Compiler
********
I: Translates program one statement at a time. 
C: Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
I: It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower. 
C: It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster.
I: No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient. 
C: Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory.
I: Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy. 
C: It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard.
I: Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters.  
C: Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.
